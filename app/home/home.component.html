    <p class="garden2"> One of the top Visayas tourist spots and destinations <br>
        in the Philippines that has some of the most beautiful beaches is Cebu. <br>
        Apart from its delicious food and colorful Sinulog Festival, fine, <br>
        white sand and clear, blue waters are often what you'll hear <br>
        about the province after all.

    <p class="garden3"> Cebuanos are very proud of their heritage. <br>
         From their food, their music, their attitude, their <br>
        religion, and overall culture, Cebu heritage remains strong <br>
         and proud. And all this could be traced to the
        city’s history.
